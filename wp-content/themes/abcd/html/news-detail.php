                    <p>The Australian-funded Gender Responsive Equitable Agriculture and Tourism (GREAT) program hosted
                        a Symposium and Summation Workshop: Engaging Women in Markets – Scaling up Local Successes
                        Nationwide in Hanoi on 27 May 2022.</p>
                    <p>Symposium attendees included Australian and Vietnamese government representatives, the private
                        sector and civil society organisations. Ethnic minority women were also represented and the
                        event concluded with an evening market and cooking show.</p>

                <div class="desc">
                    <p>Throughout the day, the GREAT program team and Government of Vietnam representatives discussed
                        evidence and lessons learned from the GREAT Program that can help inform Vietnam’s National
                        Target Programs (NTPs)implementation. The NTPs and GREAT both aspire to stronger socio-economic
                        opportunities in Vietnam’s northwest region, particularly for the ethnic communities that call
                        the region home.</p>
                    <p>GREAT is Australia’s most significant gender investment in Vietnam, totalling A$33.7 million. The
                        program works with businesses, NGOs, government and civil society partners to build more
                        inclusive business and market systems within the agriculture and tourism sectors in Son La and
                        Lao Cai provinces. It also works to ensure that local women and ethnic minorities actively
                        participate in and benefit from related economic activities and growth.</p>
                    <p>The GREAT Program began in 2017 and is now entering into a second phase which will see the
                        Program extend out to 2027. It is implemented in partnership with the Son La and Lao Cai
                        Provincial Governments and the Symposium was an important step in further cementing these
                        partnerships.</p>
                    <p>Mr Nguyen Thanh Hai from the Son La Provincial Government and Mr Le Hong Phong from the Lao Cai
                        Provincial Government both shared the experience of delivering GREAT, particularly the lessons
                        learned in relation to improving the agriculture and tourism sectors while actively working to
                        promote the economic empowerment of women.</p>

                    <p>GREAT’s business and education partners also provided an update on the establishment of business
                        services and support for the agriculture and tourism sectors in the northwest, including
                        improved access to finance, digital inclusion and the availability of market-driven skills
                        training. All of these services have been designed with the needs of women in mind, including
                        issues such as language and literacy.</p>
                    <p>The skills of just some of these women were shared with all in the evening market, cooking show
                        and cultural performances. Symposium attendees had the opportunity to sample the products,
                        produce and experiences that the governments, communities and businesses of Son La and Lao Cai
                        aspire to harness as they pursue inclusive, sustainable economic development.</p>
